Goal:
So. What do you think about Typescript so far? If you’re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know? If you have prior experience, did you learn new things from this module, perhaps with respect to ES6? Do you think Typescript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?

What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?

## Initial Thoughts on Typescript
As a complete beginner to the Typescript coding language, I am constantly find myself reconsidering if I truly ever had my first taste of a modern programming experience. At first sight, I believed in the idea that Typescript was just JavaScript with a few extra rules. After going through a few exercises utilzing Typescript though I now see these extra rules, or rather structures, more like guardrails. Initially familiarizing myself with Typescript was, and still is, confusing as I am attempting to learn both JavaScript behavior and TypeScript static checks. Albeit confusing, I feel like the explcit nature Typescript pushes me to aim for in regards to my varialbes and functions are a bonus as a beginner. One moment I feel like I am writing code that is appropriate but, Typescript tells me otherwise and it helps me prevent accidents or spending 20 minutes wondering why my code breaks instead of watching another cat video on Youtube.

### Comparing to C/C++, Python, MATLAB

### The Practicality of Typescript

## Typescript in a Athletic Standpoint

*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*


And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
