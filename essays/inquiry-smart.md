Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.

Be sure that your essay includes a textual summary of both the “smart” and “not so smart” questions, as well as a link to the StackOverFlow pages where they are located. Don’t just put the URL to the questions and force the reader to visit StackOverFlow to read the question there, then switch back to your essay to continue. Your essay should contain enough detail about the two questions so that the reader doesn’t need to visit StackOverFlow to make sense of your essay.
